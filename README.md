# RealtyStream by the ModelEarth Team

A simple Streamlit WebApp, which weighs possibilities:

- If a Job Description is Real or Fake
- If changes in local industries impact bee pollinators (coming soon)
    
Machine Learning Classification Models
- Logistic Regression
- Random Forest
- Support Vector Machines.

RealtyStream provides a range of possibilities and weighs them.  Rather than producsing a prediction, we generate a stream of possible outcomes which gradually converge toward reality as it draws closer, in the stream.
