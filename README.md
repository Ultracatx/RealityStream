# RealtyStream by the ModelEarth Team

A simple Streamlit WebApp, which weighs possibilities:

- If a Job Description is Real or Fake
- If changes in local industries impact bee pollinators (coming soon)
    
Machine Learning Classification Models
- Logistic Regression
- Random Forest
- Support Vector Machines.

RealtyStream weighs and compares a range of possible outcomes.  Rather than producing a single prediction, we generate a stream of floating datapoints which gradually converge to reality.
