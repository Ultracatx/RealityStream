[Random Bits Forest](../../models/random-bits-forest/)

# Industries&nbsp;

[Our Data Pipeline](/data-pipeline/) and [NAICS Features Data](/data-pipeline/timelines/training/naics/)

TO DO: Create input-ndustries.py that pulls data for features without saving locally.

Pull factors data from [community-timelines repo](/community-timelines)

Avoid saving features in local files, send directly to processing.

Send features and targets through other models (rbf.py, etc.)

### Python to add

	python input-industries.py [dataset]

### Datasets

**Prosperity** - Which factors forecast prosperity?
Factors: types of industries, employment levels, population density, environmental indicators
