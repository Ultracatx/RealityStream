# Our Model Skeletons

Technically the files in our "models" folder are "model skeletons", but the folder name "skeletons" was just to scary to use with real and fake things in forests. :)

ChatGPT explains:

A Random Forest implemented in Python without data could be considered as a framework or a model skeleton. Let's break down these terms:

**Framework:** A framework typically refers to a structured set of tools, libraries, and conventions that provide a foundation for building something. In the case of machine learning, frameworks like TensorFlow, PyTorch, or scikit-learn provide the infrastructure and tools necessary to implement machine learning algorithms. If you have a Python script implementing Random Forest algorithm but without data, it could be seen as a part of a machine learning framework.

**Model Skeleton:** Without data, your Random Forest implementation in Python would essentially be a skeleton or blueprint of a model. It defines the structure and logic of how the model should work, but it lacks the essential component—data—to make predictions. It's like having the blueprint of a house without any materials to build it.

In summary, a Random Forest implemented in Python without data is more like a model skeleton or a part of a machine learning framework rather than a fully functioning model. To make predictions or train the model, you would need to feed it with appropriate data.
