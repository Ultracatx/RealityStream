# Reality or Fiction Jobs

Anaylzes text to identify legitimate job posts.
This is the original Streamlit App we started from.

**It contained three models:**

- Logistic Regression
- Random Forest
- Support Vector Machines SVC

**Original Python** (Streamlit)

In the current folder, [reality-or-fiction.ipynb](reality-or-fiction.ipynb) is an alternative to running app.py for Job Description NLP models.

The data used in this model is in this [Google Sheet](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1oNvbZLod123UhYbR8oqH7hPCc3n5CRan/view?usp=share_link) and in [input/jobs](../../input/jobs/)

The terms "SVC" and "SVM" are sometimes used interchangeably, but when someone refers to an "SVC," they are usually referring to the classification variant of the algorithm. SVC is an SVM used for classification. It seeks to find the hyperplane that best separates the data points into different classes.
